Haxejs — Mobile First 框架设计
Haxejs — The next generation mobile first framework

Props:
1) Write javascript code easier, zero learn curve
Use modern, high level, strictly typed programming language Haxe(very similar to Java) to generate elegant javascript,  it provides compiler error check and code completions with many IDE tools.

2) Manage javascript libraries easier, embedded or not embedded
It can embed javascript libraries you used automatically, or copy them to a pointed place.

3) Very powerful with cut edge design of angularjs, and adapted jquery and bootstrap
Angularjs is elegant and well designed, and it is the core of haxejs framework, many good javascript libraries based on angularjs are integrated/added seemlessly.

4) Write Unit and E2E tests easier.
Jasmine, karat, protractor are included.

5) Best suited for very complicated SPA(single page app) 

6) Best suited for mobile native hybrid phonegap/cordova app



—new trend
SPA(HTML5/CSS+javascript) or MPA <—> json on http<—> server
iOS/android/wp 

—traditional way
Most HTML/CSS/javascript are dynamically generated by server side programming language, like java/php/perl/python/ruby and etc.
Ajax is becoming more and more popular, and it is an add-on to make html more responsive and better user experience.
